        <h1>Death Note Summary</h1>
           <p>so death note starts w light yagami finding this motherfucking</p>
           <p>book that tells him that when u write a name in the book then theyll die</p>
           <p>so he goes all out n writes a bunch of criminals names in the book to</p>
           <p>become a god of the new world</p>
           <p>eventually the police obviously start investigating but fail to find him at first</p>
           <p>later a guy called L suspects him of being kira (the mf with the death note) and</p>
           <p>so they start investigating him and eventually hes kinda cleared</p>
           <p>then a bunch of other shit happens honestly i can barely wrap my head around it either</p>
           <p>eventually he becomes the head of the police force and he likes leads them away</p>
           <p>in the end his shinigami ryuk kills him bc hes found out as kira</p>
           <p>i cannot give a better description the wikipedia page is literally a full page and a half</p>

            <p>OH MY GOD i fucking love this show</p>
            <p>honestly a solid 9.5/10 this show doesnt have many flaws</p>
            <p>watching the dub, it was surprisingly good usually theyre</p>
            <p>some goofy ass guys voice but i rly liked it</p>
            <p>the story was super confusing to me sometimes but aside from that</p>
            <p>it doesnt have many flaws to me. it was rly intense at times but it also</p>
            <p>was super clever with the solutions. n the ending with light dying was so fucking</p>
            <p>unexpected to me like MY GOD</p>
            <p>i couldve sworn thered be some other solution light would have but... nope.</p>
            <p>he was just killed then and there by ryuk. it was so sad but relieving to me</p>
            <p>it ends the story in such a great way and its super sad but at the same time</p>
            <p>it ended perfectly. i would highly recommend this to anyone, no matter what genre u like</p>
            <p>i almost always prefer comedy and romance stuff but this was great. 9.5/10 for me</p>
