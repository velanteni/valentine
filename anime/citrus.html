        <h1>Citrus Summary</h1>
            <p>so essentially, yuzu aihara has moved to a new school and city bc her mother got remarried.</p>
            <p>she was transferred to an all-girls school w very strict rules.</p>
            <p>this was unfortunate for the mf since she was obsessed with boys and couldn't</p>
            <p>get any boyfriends at this all girls school (surprising i know)</p>
            <p>however she meets this one SUPERRRR hot girl w black hair (mei aihara) and pretty much falls in love</p>
            <p>at first sight. but it turns out, theyre now siblings!!! who couldve guessed omg</p>
            <p>yuzu couldnt rly get mei out of her head bc they share the same room AND RLY CREEPY</p>
            <p>BORDERLINE RAPE HAPPENS?? (iirc i havent seen this show in too long)</p>
            <p>pretty much the show revolves around one girl wanting to bang the other and theres other</p>
            <p>literal sexual assault so...</p>

        <br>
        <h1 id="opinions">Opinions</h1>
            <p>honestly, this show sucks.</p>
            <p>loved the voice acting, loved the animation, but the storyline... godawful.</p>
            <p>im sorry but the main story line LITERALLY revolves around incest and sexual assault</p>
            <p>how could i not hate it?? this is literally the only show with prominent lesbian characters</p>
            <p>and its fetishized and made creepy with the plotline.</p>
            <p>i could not reccommend this less. i STRONGLY dislike this show and after watching about 9/12</p>
            <p>episodes, i couldnt continue. id recommend skipping this show for something else.</p>
